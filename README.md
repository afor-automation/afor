# Afor Automation Test Framework

The Afor framework is designed to allow creating automated test suites, which can target various applications and services such as web browser based applications, REST and SOAP services, native and hybrid mobile applications.\
Other applications can be added into the framework as desired, such as windows application capabilities.

## Getting started
The framework requires jdk 17 or higher, maven, an IDE of your choice (unless running headless), along with a browser and associated drivers if performing web browser testing or simulators/real devices and appium if testing mobile applications.

Detailed instructions can be found on the [getting started page](https://www.afor.co.nz/framework/installation/getting-started.html)

## Example test suite
To help get you started, a test suite which shows examples of both web browser based features and REST service features can be found under [afor-example](https://github.com/afor-automation/afor/tree/master/afor-example)
